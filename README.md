# Ripple

## What is this?

Ripple is a simple Android application that illustrates how network packets in a RightMesh network travel from device to device. Users can select a colour with the buttons at the bottom of the screen, select a device to send that colour to from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen, and finally press the floating "send" button. As the message travels to the selected device, all devices along the path to that device (and the recipient device itself) will change the colour on their screen to match the colour being sent. 

The user can also choose a colour and then tap the "send to all" button, which as the name implies will send the selected colour to all other devices on the mesh. This option really shows off the "ripple" effect as the messages travel outwards!

The app can be seen in use here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXp5Nj9hHcm/

To access the RightMesh settings page, just long-press the send button.
